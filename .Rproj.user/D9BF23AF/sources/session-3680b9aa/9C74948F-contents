# Actuarial Data Science Portfolio
**Data-Driven Solutions for Risk Management & Quantitative Modeling**

Welcome to my code lab. Here, I bridge the gap between **Actuarial Science** and **Data Engineering** to solve complex problems using R.

## 🚀 Core Focus
* **Risk Analytics:** Credit scoring models, claims reserving (Chain Ladder), and operational risk.
* **Quantitative Modeling:** Derivatives valuation (CRR Binomial Trees), stochastic simulations, and financial math.
* **Data Engineering:** ETL pipelines, efficient data cleaning, and vectorized algorithms in R.
