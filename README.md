# Actuarial Data Science Portfolio
**Data-Driven Solutions for Risk Management & Quantitative Modeling**

Welcome to my code lab. Here, I bridge the gap between **Actuarial Science** and **Data Engineering** to solve complex problems using R.

## 🚀 Core Focus
* **Risk Analytics:** Credit scoring models, claims reserving (Chain Ladder), and operational risk.
* **Quantitative Modeling:** Derivatives valuation (CRR Binomial Trees), stochastic simulations, and financial math.
* **Data Engineering:** ETL pipelines, efficient data cleaning, and vectorized algorithms in R.

## 📉 Key Findings (Data 1982-2024)
* **Preservation vs. Growth:** The analysis reveals that while nominal rates were high in the 80s, real returns were often negative.
* **Wealth Index:** An investment of **100 MXN** in 1982 (reinvested in CETES) has a real purchasing power of approximately **150 MXN** today.
* **Long-term Real Yield:** The geometric average real rate is roughly **< 1% per annum**, confirming CETES as a capital preservation tool rather than a wealth multiplier.
